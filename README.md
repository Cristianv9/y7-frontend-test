## Goal

#### [Download Editable Sketch & JPG Files](http://media.yellow7.com/development/y7-frontend_test.zip)

The goal of this test project is to turn a Sketch/JPG file into a working, **responsive** website. It is only one-page which consists a header with logo and navigation, carousel banner, two column body content, and a simple footer.

Since this needs to be responsive, use your discretion for how the layout will adapt to tablet and mobile.

This project is open-ended to interpret your own functionality for the content.
